Indeed, they have been perceived as containing an obstacle to the imposition of a regulatory obligation on payment service providers to reimburse customers who are victims of APP fraud. Regulation 90(1) provides that, where a payment order is executed in accordance with the unique identifier (ie the essential information identifying the account of the payee), the payment order is deemed to have been correctly executed. 19.', 'page': 7, 'title': 'phillip_vs_barclays.pdf', 'start_line': 28}, {'content': ' The government agencies responsible for regulating the provision of banking services are the Financial Conduct Authority and, in relation to payments, the Payment Systems Regulator, established under section 40 of the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Act 2013.

The complaint argued that banks could take steps to reduce the risks of consumers authorising push payments to bank accounts controlled by fraudsters and that placing liability on banks (including the bank where the fraudster’s account is held) to reimburse losses from such scams would incentivise banks to take such measures.', 'page': 8, 'title': 'phillip_vs_barclays.pdf', 'start_line': 3}]\n"

      "\n",
      "14  On 19 March 2018 Mrs Philipp visited her local branch of the Bank once more and sought to make a third transfer. On this occasion her instructions were to pay £250,000 (the remaining balance of the funds received from her husband’s account with Tilney) to the account in the UAE in the name of Bonito Systems Ltd. However, Mrs Philipp was told that her account had been blocked pending a review, and the transfer did not take place. Still acting at the request of the fraudster, she then called the Bank’s fraud department. The transcript of the conversation records that in this call Mrs and Dr Philipp tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade the Bank’s staff to lift the block on her account by claiming (falsely) that they needed to make an urgent payment under a contract which they would lose if the payment was not made on that day. \n",
      "\n",
      "15  Following a third visit from DC Claridge on 26 March 2018, Dr and Mrs Philipp finally came to realise that they had been the victims of a fraud. Mrs Philipp notified the Bank of this on 27 March 2018. Some two months later, on and after 31 May 2018, the Bank made attempts to recall the funds which had been transferred to the UAE but these attempts were unsuccessful. Dr and Mrs Philipp have therefore lost £700,000. This money represented the bulk of their life savings. \n",
      "\n",
      "16  Although the relationship between a bank and an account holder is one of contract, such contracts are made and performed in a heavily regulated legal environment. For example, where the customer who holds the account is a consumer, any term of the contract which is unfair to the customer is not binding on the customer: see section 62 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015. Banks are also subject to various regulatory duties imposed by or under legislation. The most significant legislation applicable to payments is the Payment Services Regulations 2017 (SI 2017/752). These Regulations, originally introduced to transpose the second EU Payment Services Directive 2015/2366 into national law, have been retained (with minor modifications) following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. They apply to a wide range of payment transactions. 17. \n",
      "\n",
      "17  Part 7 of the Payment Services Regulations establishes rights and obligations relating to the provision of payment services by banks and other “payment service providers”. Among other things, these regulations define when a payment transaction is to be regarded as having been authorised by the payer (regulation 67); impose obligations on payment service providers to execute authorised payment transactions promptly (regulations 86 and 91); and require a payment service provider to refund to the payer the amount of an unauthorised payment (no later than the end of the business day following the day on which it becomes aware of the unauthorised transaction) (regulation 76(2)). \n",
      "\n",
      "18  The relevant provisions of the Payment Services Regulations are largely concerned with establishing rights and obligations of payment service users and providers in relation to unauthorised payment transactions. They do not provide for reimbursement of any payments which the payer has authorised. They therefore do not offer any means of redress for a customer who is a victim of APP fraud. Indeed, they have been perceived as containing an obstacle to the imposition of a regulatory obligation on payment service providers to reimburse customers who are victims of APP fraud. Regulation 90(1) provides that, where a payment order is executed in accordance with the unique identifier (ie the essential information identifying the account of the payee), the payment order is deemed to have been correctly executed. 19. \n",
      "\n",
      "19  The government agencies responsible for regulating the provision of banking services are the Financial Conduct Authority and, in relation to payments, the Payment Systems Regulator, established under section 40 of the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Act 2013. Section 68(1) of that Act allows a designated representative body to make a complaint to the Payment Systems Regulator that “a feature, or a combination of features, of a market in the United Kingdom for services provided by payment systems is, or appears to be, significantly damaging the interests of those who use … those services.” In September 2016 the Consumers’ Association, which is a designated representative body, made such a complaint to the Payment Systems Regulator about lack of protection for consumers against harm caused by APP fraud. The complaint argued that banks could take steps to reduce the risks of consumers authorising push payments to bank accounts controlled by fraudsters and that placing liability on banks (including the bank where the fraudster’s account is held) to reimburse losses from such scams would incentivise banks to take such measures. \n",

      " George Orwell – Animal Farm Summary and Analysis Eric Blair, well-known with his pen name George Orwell, was a strong believer of democratic socialism. He fought in wars and witnessed the cruelties of the dictatorship. Being an essayist and novelist his political viewpoints came forth in the form of Animal Farm. The novella is an allegory and attacks the rule of Stalin with the help of animal characters. Orwell explained about his dystopian �o�ella a�d the i�te�tio� �ehi�d his atte�pt th�ough the essa� �Wh� I W�ite�. \n",
      "\n",
      " Animal Farm, after getting rejected by many publishing houses due to the political satires, finally got published in the year 1945, 17 th  August, while the essay was written in the year 1946. The novella is fou�d i� te� �hapte�s a�d its o�igi�al title �as �A�i�al Fa��: A Fai�y “to���. The su�title was removed in the American version of the novella and now the subtitle is rarely used. The story resembles the Russian Revolution, Spanish Civil war, Soviet Union and the rule of Stalin. \n",
      "\n",
      " Mr. Jones is a drunkard and the proprietor of the Manor Farm. One day he gets so drunk that he forgets to close the pop-holes and goes to bed. All the animals in the farm flutter and stir to meet at the big barn to listen to the dram of old Major – a white boar. The boar is the most esteemed animal in the farm and everyone was eager to hear about his dream and speech. Everyone attends the gathering except for Moses, the tame raven of Mr. Jones. \n",
      "\n",
      " Old Major states that, he may not live long and he has something important to say to the other animals. He emphasizes on the slavery they were undergoing in the Manor Farm and about the miserable life ahead. The root cause of their predicament is the domination of the humans, who are incapable of producing milk, laying eggs, hunting rabbits and pulling the plough. Old Major reasons that their enslavement and hard life are caused by the tyranny of man. \n",
      "\n",
      " Old Major speaks of a Rebellion that will overthrow the humans and lets the animals be free. He is sceptical whether it will come in his lifetime, but is sure about the day of the revolt. The animals get so inspired by the thought of the rebellion. During the discussion, some wild rats enter and the dogs try to catch them. The white boar emphasizes that unity should exist amongst the animals; therefo�e, he de��ees that �All a�i�als a�e e�ual�. \n",
      "\n",
      " Old Major shifts to explain his dream in which, the human race is vanished. It reminds him of a song learnt during his childhood – Beasts of England. He sings the Beasts of England [find the image below] and it excites the animals. They pick up the song and begin to sing it with great pitch and hope. Hearing the sounds made by the farm animals, Mr. Jones fires a pellet, fearful of the presence of a fox and every animal slips away from the big barn. \n",
      "\n",
      " George Orwell presents through Old Major a Utopian society where everyone can live without any fetters. He explains the consequences of being a slave, as well enumerated in the case of Boxer [the strongest of the animals in the Manor Farm]. The wise boar teaches them the Beasts of England, where there is clear inspiration about the golden time in the future. However, this has to be achieved through toil. Old Major, though speaks of rebellion his ideas lead to a socialistic society, where every animal is equal. The emphasis on the wild rats shows that, George Orwell beliefs that in Socialism there is place for everyone and any individual deserves a chance. \n",
      "\n",
      " Only three nights later, the wise old Major dies in his sleep and he is buried near the orchard. The animals inspired by the speech of old Major were very active discussing the thoughts and the future ahead. There were many meetings and the pigs were given the mantle to take care of them, because they were considered as the cleverest of all the animals in the farm. The task was handled well by t�o �ou�g �oa�s �a�el�, “�o��all a�d Napoleo�. “�ueale�’s a�othe� pig �ho �as good at spee�hes and he could convince anyone through the use of words. \n",
      "\n",
      " The three boars developed the ideas of old Major and make it into a philosophy known as Animalism. There were many meetings after the death of old Major and some members doubted the need of attending the meetings or discussing about the rebellion, as they were unsure that it is unlikely to happen in their lifetime. However, Snowball convinces them about a bright future. When Moses tells about a fabled Sugar Candy Land, the pigs try to ensure that the animals do not fall for the false statements of the crow. \n",
      "\n",
      " Boxer and Clover – cart horses, become faithful disciples of Animalism. They accepted pigs as their tea�he�s a�d �elie�ed that e�e��thi�g �o�i�g f�o� the� is t�ue. As the �eeti�gs a�d �Beasts of E�gla�d� �e�t o�, i� a t�ist of tale Mr. Jones loses money in a lawsuit. He starts to drink and stops taking care of the farm. His idle men never took concern of the animals and in June Mr. Jones forgot to feed the animals and the frustrated animals retaliate against the humans in the farm. Even thought, Mr. Jones and his men try to control the animals, their efforts were not enough. They run for protection after realizing that the animals have won and Mrs. Jones too runs away from another side followed by Moses. \n",
      "\n",
      " The animals achieve an unbelievable victory, but they circled round the farm to see the humans are completely gone.  They search everywhere and find no traces of Jones or his men. The tools used to castrate animals, ribbons [which is disliked by Mollie - the white mare], nosebags, blinkers, etc. are thrown into the fire. Everything that reminded of the cruelty of Mr. Jones was destroyed and all the a�i�als sa�g �ith a� up�oa� the �Beasts of E�gla�d�. \n",
      "\n",
      " In the morning they admire the feat they have accomplished and they enter the house of Mr. Jones too observe the life of humans. After having breakfast, Snowball and Napoleon call for meeting and reveal that the pigs have been reading since the death of old Major.  Later, they change the name of MANOR FARM into ANIMAL FARM. Snowball paints the name by holding a paint brush with his trotter over the original name. Then they declare the SEVEN COMMANDMENTS of the Animal farm and paint it on a wall. \n",
      "\n",
      " Amidst all this, the cows utter a loud lowing because they were not milked for 24-hours. The pigs manage to milk the cows and the five buckets of milk are taken into possession by Napoleon to serve a purpose. He asks the animals to take heed of the harvest rather than the milk and they do so. \n",
      "\n",
      " George Orwell slightly hints the fate of the animals after throwing away the humans with the behaviour of Napoleon while taking decision about the milk. Further, the philosophical differences amongst the animals are shown through Mollie and Moses. While Moses represents a more cunning and faithful slave, Mollie represents a bourgeoisie individual who is always greedy for the lavish luxuries of life. They have their mind of their own; while Moses flies away Mollie seems to struggle with the idea of burning her possessions. Orwell sets up the tone of the novella through them and hints about the consequences of relying on an individual to run the community. \n",
      "\n",
      " The animals toiled hard and the harvest came better than ever. It was difficult for them to use the human use intended implements, but the pigs modified them to fit the limbs of the animals. The horses helped in raking and mowing of the field, while the pigs gave instructions to the animals without working. They were all happy about the fact that they successfully produced a great harvest [better than Mr. Jones] and the harvest belongs to them entirely. \n",
      "\n",
      " Boxer, the cart horse, was the inspiration to every animal in the farm. He always showed willingness to take on the hardest tasks and he made a motto – �I �ill �o�k ha�de�� to keep hi�self goi�g. He gets to work half an hour early and does small works even when he finds some leisure to rest. \n",
      "\n",
      " Everyone worked in harmony except for Mollie and a cat. They were usually late and the cat would disappear all of a sudden and reappear during the dining sessions. \n",
      "\n",
      " Old Benjamin – the donkey - worked in his usual pace not showing any opinion towards the Rebellion and always says that donkeys live longer than any other animal as a cryptic answer to his indifference towards the changes in the Animal Farm. There was no work on Sunday and all the animals participate in a ceremony. \n",
      "\n",
      " The ceremony involved flag hoisting of the Animal Farm, which is created by Snowball. He finds a green coloured tablecloth and paints in white a hoof and a horn. The horn and hoof represent the �Repu�li�a� of the A�i�als�, �hile the g�ee� �olou� s���olizes the g�ee� pastu�es of E�gla�d. \n",
      "\n",
      " Snowball tries different things and tries to organize committees aimed to educate the animals. \n",
      "\n",
      " However, the opinions of Snowball and Napoleon always clashed. \n",
      "\n",
      " “�o��all’s idea of edu�ati�g the a�i�als �o�e so�e su��ess as the dogs lea��ed to �ead, goat Mu�iel was able to read newspapers, Benjamin read well but never showed his talents to the pigs, Clover completed the alphabet but cannot put the letters together to form a word, Mollie only learnt her name and Boxer never could get past D. The other animals were unable to learn so Snowball took the essence of the seven commandments and created a maxim: �FOUR LEG“ GOOD, TWO LEG“ BAD�. \n",
      "\n",
      " The birds felt that being two legged species, the maxim is not fairly put, but Snowball explains them that the wings are equivalent to legs. Soon, the maxim was painted on the wall above the commandments and sheep loved the maxim. \n",
      "\n",
      " Bluebell and Jessie gave birth to nine puppies and Napoleon takes responsibility to rear them and educate them. He takes them to the harness-room, which can be reached only through a ladder. \n",
      "\n",
      " Later, it is revealed that the milk taken every day is mixed into the mash and so are the windfall apples. The animals were not in a complete agreement to the situation and Napoleon sends Squealer to provide an explanation. \n",
      "\n",
      " Squeale� states that �ost pigs dislike apples a�d �ilk, �ut the� �o�tai� su�sta��es that helps a pig’s well-being. Pigs being the operators of the Animal Farm require enough necessities to take care of their brains; otherwise, according to Squealer, the management would collapse and Mr. Jones would come back. The animals were in a total agreement to the words of the pig and felt that these necessities are obvious for pigs. \n",
      "\n",
      " The power of unity is well portrayed by George Orwell through the first part of this chapter. The animals work hard and reap great benefits, a greater achievement for they had neither proper equipment nor the experience to do things themselves. \n",
      "\n",
      " The contrast between Benjamin and Boxer, Snowball and Napoleon shows the different philosophies in a community. Benjamin seems to be aware of the consequences of a communistic setup, while Boxer is too loyal to freedom that he thinks of only working harder. On the other hand, Snowball shows the true spirit of communism, where everyone deserves equal rights [even though the rule is in the hands of a few] and Napoleon plots for the benefit of the pigs and submerges the facts with the help of Squealer. \n",
      "\n",
      " The flag created by Snowball is a look alike of the communist flag. While the communist flag consists of red background with a sickle and hammer, George Orwell changes the colour of the flag of Animal Farm into green and places hoof and horn. \n",
      "\n",
      " Everyone in the vicinity of the farm and nearly half of the county got the news of the rebellion of the animals. Snowball along with Napoleon made effort to spread the news through pigeons and teach othe� a�i�als the �Beasts of E�gla�d�. Mea��hile, M�. Jo�es spe�t his ti�e d�i�ki�g, �la�i�g the animals and cursing his fate. \n",
      "\n",
      " The two adjacent farm owners – Mr. Frederick and Mr. Pilkington, pitied the condition of the fellow farm owner. But, they looked it as an opportunity to seize the Manor Farm. Fortunately, for the animals, Mr. Frederick the owner of Pinchfield and Mr. Pilkington the owner of Foxwood detested ea�h othe�’s p�ese��e. The�efo�e, the� �ould �ot �o�e i�to a� ag�ee�e�t a�out getti�g hold of the Manor Farm. \n",
      "\n",
      " However, to prevent their animals into revolting against them, they spread out rumours like starvation, quarrelling, cannibalism, torture, etc. increasing in the Manor Farm. The rumours were believed by some, but most did not believe the words. There were many instances of animals revolting against their owners. Bulls, sheep and cows of several farms refused to obey. The Beasts of England was heard everywhere and humans punished the animals singing or spelling the name. The song was everywhere and there was a fear amongst the humans. They trembled and feared that all the happenings will lead to their doom. \n",
      "\n",
      " In October, Mr. Jones along with few men from the adjacent farms attempted to regain his farm. He brought five men holding sticks and he came with a gun. Snowball and the others expected this move from Mr. Jones and were prepared to fight them. Snowball created some plans to tackle Mr. \n",
      "\n",
      " Jones by reading a book on the campaigns of Julius Caesar. \n",
      "\n",
      " The two initial attacks by the animals were meek and Mr. Jones men easily sent the animals running. \n",
      "\n",
      " However, it was the plan of Snowball to created disorder by disturbing their concentration on attack. \n",
      "\n",
      " Once, the humans felt that animals were running for their lives they ran after them without any pattern. The animals lead the men towards the yard where three horses, three cows and the pigs were waiting for the humans. \n",
      "\n",
      " After the signal from Snowball, the animals in waiting charge towards the men. Snowball dashes fo��a�d a�d M�. Jo�es fi�es the gu� at hi�. The pellets f�o� the gu� g�aze “�o��all’s �a�k a�d kill a sheep. Enraged, Snowball tackles Mr. Jones and he falls into a pile of dung. Boxer fights ferociously and knocks a Foxwood boy unconscious. The rest of the men were nervous and ran to protect themselves. The animals chase them to the gates and within five minutes they achieve a glorious victory. \n",
      "\n",
      " Boxer feels sad for the unconscious stable boy and thinks that he killed him. He expresses grief and e�phasizes that he does�’t �a�t to kill a��o�e e�e� if it is a hu�a�. Ho�e�e�, “�o��all �o�soles him and says that there is no place for sentimentality in a battle. Suddenly, they feel that Mollie is missing and they fear that men took her. Actually, after hearing the gun shot she hides in her stall burying her head inside the hay. While they were busy talking to Mollie, the stable boy wakes up and runs out of the Animal Farm. \n",
      "\n",
      " An immediate celebration followed with the hoisting of the flag and si�gi�g of �Beasts of E�gla�d�. \n",
      "\n",
      " “�o��all deli�e�s a spee�h a�d �eite�ates the i�po�ta��e of keepi�g o�e’s life �et�ee� the hu�a�s and the Animal Farm. The animals create medals for the animals that fought with valour in the battle. Both Boxer and Snowball we�e a�a�ded �A�i�al He�o, Fi�st Class�. The sheep that died du�i�g the �attle �as a�a�ded �A�i�al He�o, “e�o�d Class�. The �attle �as �alled as the BATTLE OF THE COWSHED as the ambush was laid in that place. They decide to fire the gun twice every year on Twelfth of October – the day the Battle of the Cowshed took place, and on the day of Rebellion [Midsummer Day]. \n",
      "\n",
      " George Orwell demarcates the difference between unity and chaos. The neighbourhood farm owner Mr. Pilkington and Mr. Frederick are in a constant state of disagreement. This neither helps Mr. \n",
      "\n",
      " Jones nor their plan of getting the Manor Farm. On the other hand, the animals stay together in the fight [except for Mollie] and battle for a genuine cause. With that unity and planning they secure the Animal Farm and shatter the hopes of Mr. Jones who only comes with five other men. \n",
      "\n",
      " The leadership skills of Snowball greatly shine in this chapter and the way he leads the animals is inspirational. Even though, he gets grazed by a bullet he thinks of the greater good and charges towards the enemy. This spirit spreads to every animal and they fight with every ounce of energy, especially Boxer. The presentation of medals, naming the battle and declaration of celebration mark the growth of animals into civilized species with clear awareness of their next step [or do they?]. \n",

      " As time passed and winter arrived, Mollie grew more preoccupied with herself. She came late to work, often found excuses and would run to the drinking pool whenever she feels like it. The worst thing is that Clover observes Mollie getting pampered by a human from the neighbourhood farm – Foxwood. However, Mollie denies the fact and after she runs away. The pigeons announce that Mollie is with a man, who is feeding her sugar lumps and allowing her to wear ribbons. By hearing this, no animal ever spoke about Mollie. \n",

However, the meetings were always won by Snowball because of his eloquent speeches; but, Napoleon was able to bring support for himself. He made sheep his followers and whenever Snowball tried to give a speech, the sheep �leated �Fou� legs good, t�o legs �ad�. \n",

      " Snowball planned several schemes that reduced the cartage labour and Napoleon never had a plan of his own. He simply disagreed to everything said by Snowball. After doing a lot of survey, Snowball finds a fit place to establish a Windmill. The windmill, according to Snowball, helps to provide electricity to the farm and keep the animals warm in winter. Further, it could be used to run a milking machine, circular saw, chaff-cutter, etc. The animals were astonished to hear about the innovative ideas of Snowball and in a few weeks the pig was able to create plans for the windmill. \n",
      "\n",
      " Snowball remained for hours studying books to construct the windmill. He drew plans in a shed, which was his room of study. Every animal looked at the plans at least once in a day. Napoleon never took interest in the plan and when he did saw them, he urinated on them. The Animal Farm divided into two groups on the issue of building a windmill. Snowball, did agree that the windmill would be hard to construct but it ensured a bright future with less labour and more food. Napoleon insisted that in the process of building all the animals would die; therefore, he emphasized on the production of food. Be�ja�i�, the do�ke�, did�’t take sides a�d �as neutral about both the opinions. \n",

      " The two pigs debated on the increase of security to the Animal Farm as well.

The ti�e �a�e, �he� “�o��all’s pla� of �o�st�u�ti�g a windmill was put to vote. During his speech, he was distracted by sheep but he went forward with such eloquence that he won over the crowd. At this precise moment, all the animals hear a horrifying baying sound. \n",

      " The animals see nine huge dogs with brass collars charging towards Snowball. The pig escapes narrowly from their jaws. He escaped through the hedge and he never returned. The animals were terrified to look at the dogs and they were very close to Napoleon.

Fu�the�, the animals would assemble only to sing the song and hoist the flag; all the decisions were announced to be taken by pig committees. \n",
      "\n",
      " Four young porkers squealed at the disturbed decision of sending Snowball out and cancelling the debate. The dogs silence them by growling fiercely. When a question about the bravery of Snowball was raised, Squealer answers the� �� stati�g that “�o��all’s i��ol�e�e�t i� the Battle of Co�shed is exaggerated. In the end, he declares that everything is done for the greater good and is an act to prevent the re-entry of Mr. Jones.

During Sundays, Napoleon gave instructions for the animals and in three weeks time he announced that the windmill is going to be built. The animals were surprised to hear that Napoleon wants to build something that he sternly opposed. Squealer explains to the animals that the concept of windmill was stolen by Snowball from Napoleon. Therefore, Napoleon tactically opposed the windmill to send away Snowball from the farm. The animals, although were not satisfied with the answer, never raised a question about it. \n",
      "\n",
      " George Orwell hints in the previous chapters about the domination of Napoleon and his intentions to rule the farm rather than run it. This becomes clear when he overthrows Snowball and makes everyone silent. It could be understood that Napoleon planned this way before the announcement of the windmill. He usurps the puppies in the name of education, seizes the supply of apples and milk claiming that pigs need them more, teaches the sheep an axiom to go against Snowball and opposes the construction of the windmill. \n",
      "\n",
      " The hypocritical nature of those in power is shown by Orwell through Napoleon. Further, he deceives everyone with the help of Squealer and makes the animals believe that Snowball is a treacherous pig without any obedience and loyalty. This indicates that Napoleon was thinking above all the animals as if he was the supreme ruler. It is a direct on the different types of government especially communism and despotism. \n",
      "\n",
      "  The animals worked as slaves all that year, but felt happy that the hard work they were putting was for their own well-being. They worked for sixty hours a week and their work load was increased by Napoleon, who declares that animals should voluntarily contribute on Sunday afternoons and the failure of attendance leads to the splicing of rations. Although, they put such hard work the harvest decreased that year and they could see the suffering ahead in the winter. \n",
      "\n",
      " The biggest difficulty was the construction of the windmill. Everything was available like sand, cement, limestone quarry, etc. but the problem was breaking the huge stones [in the quarry of limestone] into transferrable pieces.  No animal was able to use the tools designed by and for the humans. After many weeks of hopeless efforts they get the idea of using gravity. The animals with all the effort dragged a boulder to the top of the quarry and dropped it from there. The broken stone was gathered and transferred with the help or cartloads to the construction site. By late summer, the animals were successful in gathering enough stone to start the windmill and it indeed began. \n",

      " The whole process was laborious and sometimes the boulder released from the top of the quarry �ould�’t ��eak. The effo�t took a da� a�d it �ea�t that a da�’s effo�t �e�t i� �ain. Boxer stood as inspiration to all the animals whose strength seemed equal to all the other animals. He worked so hard that Clover warned him to be careful as all that strain can lead to problems. However, he resumed to his axioms and continued to put in all his strength. He woke up three quarters an hour early than others; work individually on spare day and leisure. The animals received their ration equal to the ration in the time of Mr. Jones; but, they were content it was for their own good. \n",
      "\n",
      " Gradually, the Animal Farm witnessed the deficiency of certain supplies such as dog biscuits, paraffin oil, iron, nails and strings. These supplies cannot be produced in the farm; hence, Napoleon announces that Animal Farm is going to arrange a trade with other farms to procure the supplies. It brought uneasiness into the animals and the four young pigs protested. But, the dogs growled to sile��e the pigs a�d Napoleo�’s spee�h �ade it �lea� that t�ade �as �e�essa�� �ith M�.

On the other hand, the humans discussed about the Farm much and their hate has developed much. However, an inner sense of �espe�t leads to the use of �A�i�al Fa��� i�stead of �Ma�o� Fa��� �� the�.

      "\n",
      " During this time, the pigs took the liberty of moving into the farmhouse where Mr. Jones used to live. The animals remember that a resolution has been made about the prohibition of using the farmhouse. However, Squealer convinces them by stating that Napoleon had to move to the farmhouse to protect the dignity of the Animal Farm as a leader. Therefore, he moved from the sty to the bed. Boxer emphasized that Napoleon was always right. \n",

      " Clover was not entirely convinced; therefore, he asks Muriel to read the Fourth Commandment. She announces that on the wall it says – �NO ANIMAL “HALL “LEEP IN A BED  WITH SHEETS �.

After a few days, an announcement came that pigs would wake up an hour late than usual. \n",

The i�itial �ega�d fo� the principles or Seven Commandments of Animalism is disregarded by Napoleon under the name of Sacrifice. The trade with Mr. Whymper points that the future of the Animal Farm will be similar to the days experienced under Mr. Jones. Further, this is a direct violation of the First Commandment – �Whate�e� goes upo� t�o legs is a� e�e���. This shows that: �L�����y �� � �����������l ����� ������� ��� long ������� �� �l����y.� Squealer is shown as that loyal hand to Napoleon, who can alter anything. He even changes the Fourth Commandment to make it convenient for the leader and the other pigs. Napoleon seems to completely understand the nature of the working class animals and uses his words to convince them to do anything. It is evident; when he declares that the windmill was ruined by Snowball and asks the animals to work even harder. Napoleon and Squealer seized every opportunity after the exile of Snowball to ensure that they control everything in the Animal Farm. \n",

      " There was huge lack of food in January and potatoes [which were not covered properly] became discoloured and soft. The rations were cut and sometimes they had to suffice with mangel beet and chaff. However, they did not reveal to the human world about their starvation and to stop the rumours about their suffering, Napoleon planned to use Mr. Whymper. Whenever, he visited the Animal Farm he was shown bins full of meal and grain. In reality, the bin was filled completely with sand and only the top portion was covered with meal and grain. \n",
      "\n",
      " By the end of January, there arose a necessity to get food from the outside world. The animals were starving and Napoleon seldom appeared in public. The hens were ordered to give four hundred of their eggs per week to stop the Animal Farm from starvation. The hens were not ready to make this sacrifice and three Black Minorca pullets led the hens to protest against the wish of Napoleon. In turn, the pig ordered to stop their ration and any other animal helping the hens shall be put to death. The protest went on for five days, �ut the� �ould�’t a�hie�e su��ess. “o, the he�s �e�t �a�k to the nests. As many as nine hens died and they were buried.

That night Squealer announced that news came that Snowball was dealing with Mr. Frederick and they are planning to attack the Animal Farm. Squealer further explains that Snowball was always in league with Mr. Jones and he was a secret agent. He was the one who purposefully led the animals into an ambush in the Battle of the Cowshed. But, the animals could only remember Snowball charging forward and achieving them victory. Some even expressed their opinion and said that he took a gunshot as well. \n",

But they never doubt how the pigs received the whiskey crate and how the money was acquired – obviously from the slaughterer who bought Boxer. \n",
      "\n",
      " Now that Boxer is gone the fate of the animals is clearly visible and they for the remainder of their lives will live in darkness – a darkness which the pigs would claim as a shadow cast by Napoleon to protect them from the outside world. This is a Universal situation where the public remain in the shadows and the leaders do things without the consent of the people. Moreover, they do it for their own benefits rather than trying to help the public. \n",

      " As years went on many of the smaller animals that were in the rebellion die. There were no animals except the pigs, Benjamin, Clover and Raven that could remember the days of the rebellion. Mr. \n",

      "\n",
      " The Animal Farm expanded and two fields were bought by Napoleon from Mr. Pilkington. The windmill was complete and revealed that it was not meant for generating electricity rather it was built to mill corn to generate income. The words of Snowball and the decrease of labour mentioned by him were not considered by Napoleon. \n",
      "\n",
      " It seemed to the animals that the farm got richer but the animals never seem to get richer or happier with the exception of pigs and dogs. Of course, Squealer always explained to the animals about the necessity of having money within the circle of pigs and dogs. The animals cannot remember the days of Mr. Jones or the early rebellion except for Benjamin. \n",
      "\n",
      " The animals were still hopeful and had a sense of pride about working for animals rather than humans. Their dreams continued and historical incidents became heroic legends. They believed that someday they will see the England dreamt by Old Major. \n",
      "\n",
      " In early summer, the sheep were summoned by Squealer and they spent the day near the birch saplings. For an entire week the sheep were kept in that place supervised by Squealer. The sheep returned one evening right at the moment when the animals finished their work. Suddenly, Clover neighed in a very loud noise and it startled everyone. The animals rush into the yard to see what happened. \n",
      "\n",
      " Squealer was walking on his hind legs. \n",
      "\n",
      " He was followed by the other pigs and finally came Napoleon with a whip in his hand. The animals were amazed to witness the impossible, but soon got terrified to look at the pigs standing on two legs. The sheep broke into bleating – �Fou� legs good, t�o legs  better �. \n",
      "\n",
      " Clover was very upset and with the help of Benjamin reaches the place where the Seven Commandments were written. To their amazement there were no Seven Commandments and Benjamin read out the words written on the wall. \n",
      "\n",
      " Nothing seemed strange for them after reading the commandment. The pigs carrying whips, walking on hind legs, installing a telephone, ordering newspaper and the pigs wearing the old clothes of Mr. \n",
      "\n",
      " Jones. \n",
      "\n",
      " One afternoon, the humans were allowed to visit the farm and to inspect the marvels found in the Animal Farm. During that evening, it seemed like the pigs were having a celebration with the humans. With Clover leading the other animals slowly crept near a window to witness what was happening. Napoleon occupied the seat of honour and seen playing cards with others. For a moment they stop playing and Mr. Pilkington announces a toast. He expresses his amazement at the way the animals were working in the Animal Farm. From him, the animals get to know that in no other farm in England were animals worked more or had lesser food. \n",
      "\n",
      " M�. Pilki�gto� al�a�s �efe��ed to the a�i�als that �o�ked i� the A�i�al Fa�� as �lo�e� a�i�als� a�d he �o�pa�es the� to the �lo�e� �o�ki�g �lass hu�a�s�. He fi�all� �o�g�atulates the pigs a�d for the prosperity of the farm. Napoleon through his speech too expressed joy about the situation and was mindful that there are still some things in the farm that needs suppressing. Things like Sunday meetings, honouring the skull of Old Major, having a flag with horn and hoof were some of the things Napoleon wanted to take care of immediately. \n",
      "\n",
      " To the surprise of everyone in the room, Napoleon announces that the farm will no longer be called as Animal Farm but would resume its former name – The Manor Farm. Clover and the other animals were chilled to the bone and they move away silently. \n",
      "\n",
      " After reaching twenty yards, they hear uproar and rush back to the window. There was a violent quarrel and it seemed to start from Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington. The reason seemed silly – �ea�h played an ace of spades si�ulta�eousl�� – but was enough to setup a fight between the pigs and the humans. \n",
      "\n",
      " Clover and the other animals could not distinguish between a man and a pig or a pig and a man. \n",
      "\n",
      " The� �ould�’t diffe�e�tiate �et�ee� the pigs a�d the hu�a�s, the� all looked the same. \n",
      "\n",
      " George Orwell shows the inevitable in a very chilling manner. All the hopes carried by the animals for a better life were shattered by the invitation of rival humans into the farm. The fact that the pigs lea��t to �alk o� hi�d legs is a g�eat i�di�atio� that pigs do�’t �a�t to li�e like a�i�als; �ut, the� desired to become humans. \n",
      "\n",

This sho�s that the ��eatu�es i� that �oo� have the same sense of purpose i.e. to suppress the hopes of people or animals and survive from their hard work. \n",
      "\n",
      " The quarrel also suggests that there is always a struggle for power when two leaders come together. \n",
      "\n",
      " Although, Mr. Pilkington and Napoleon were completely totalitarian – when it came to adjusting among themselves – the� �ould�’t �ea� the sight of each other. All the forgotten differences might have sprung into the mind and all it required was an ace of spade. \n",
      "\n",
      " George Orwell leaves the reader there and creates suspense about the future of the Animal Farm. \n",
      "\n",
      " There are many questions that need answering like: What happened to Snowball? \n",
      "\n",
      " Will Snowball ever return to the Animal Farm? \n",
      "\n",
      " How can the animals fight out of their current situation? \n",
      "\n",
      " But, all the answers linger between hope and vanity - the two powerful emotions that set the pace of the novella from the beginning. \n",
      "\n",
      " Animal Farm Summary and Analysis given here direct the novella as a universal picture, where the suffering of people through the decisions of those in power is shown. However, Animal Farm clearly reflects certain incidents around the Russian Revolution and the consequences of it. George Orwell carefully writes the satire that seems to parallel the communist influence in Russia. \n",
      "\n",
      " The people of Russia were suffering from the tyrannical rule of Tsar Nicholas II [Mr. Jones]. He was called as Nicholas the bloody for his endeavours as an Emperor. At the same time the communist ideas of Karl Marx influenced everyone and were further revolutionized by Lenin [Old Major]. The revolution led to the abduction of Tsar and a communist government was formed. Lenin was the one who made Russia [Manor Farm] into U.S.S.R [Animal Farm]. \n",
      "\n",
      " Leon Trotsky [Snowball] was a strong believer of the ideals of communism [Animalism] and aimed to improve the working class of the country, whereas Joseph Stalin [Napoleon] believed in taking po�e� f�o� the people, �athe� tha� gi�i�g it to the�. Whe� T�otsk�’s poli�ies i�te��upted the suppressive thoughts of Stalin, he was expelled from the country and assassinated. Even after years of his death, “tali�’s �e� �la�ed T�otsk� fo� the suffe�i�gs of the people. \n",
      "\n",
      " Gradually, the working class [Boxer, Benjamin, Clover...] suffered more than they did in the rule of Tsar but they were not able to realize it.  Stalin expands his power in the International scenario through various trade ideas and along with his companions began to live a life of luxury just like Tsar Ni�holas. Ma�� asso�iates of T�otsk� �e�e killed �� the KGB, “tali�’s spe�ial poli�e [Dogs], u�de� the name of purge [confessions by the animals] and Stalin made efforts to eliminate all those who were loyal to Trotsky. \n",
      "\n",
      " Joseph Stalin lingered dangerously amongst the capitalist allies [Mr. Pilkington] and Adolf Hitler [Mr. \n",
      "\n",
      " Frederick] not clearly showing faith to any one of them. In 1939, Stalin joined hands with Adolf Hitler which was an unexpected move. They sign the Non-Aggression Pact to stay in good friendship. But, Hitler attacks the western frontier of Russia few after signing the pact. This results in the death of more than 25-million people of Russia and the influential infrastructure [windmill] gets destroyed. \n",
      "\n",
      " During the World War – II, Tehran Conference (1943) was conducted to ensure peace amongst different nations of the world. Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin were present to discuss about peace and how to achieve it.  But, they had their own opinions and disagreements and the war continued for two years after the conference. George Orwell fittingly uses the conference [card game] as the end to the Animal Farm. Everyone involved in the conference had their own schemes and were trying to hold the thread themselves. Therefore, peace was not achieved immediately just as in the card game where the pigs and the animals had their own intentions to dominate one another. When Mr. Pilkington and Napoleon were found to cheat the whole idea of working together gets disrupted. \n",
      "\n",
      " The Russian working class, under the dictatorship of Stalin, realize that �All Hu�a�s a�e e�ual, but so�e hu�a�s a�e �o�e e�ual than others�. \n",
      "\n",
      " Just like in the Animal Farm where some animals became superior to the others using politics, schemes, emotions and dirty plots. \n",

      "449  NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued. The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader. See  United States  v.  Detroit Timber & Lumber Co.,  200 U. S. 321, 337. SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES DOBBS, STATE HEALTH OFFICER OF THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH,  ET AL .  v . JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION  ET AL . CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR No. 19–1392. Argued December 1, 2021—Decided June 24, 2022 Mississippi’s Gestational Age Act provides that “[e]xcept in a medical emergency or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality, a person shall not intentionally or knowingly perform . . . or induce an abortion of an unborn human being if the probable gestational age of the unborn hu- man being has been determined to be greater than fifteen (15) weeks.” Miss. Code Ann. §41–41–191.  Respondents—Jackson Women’s Health Organization, an abortion clinic, and one of its doctors—challenged the Act in Federal District Court, alleging that it violated this Court’s prec- edents establishing a constitutional right to abortion, in particular  Roe v.  Wade , 410 U. S. 113, and  Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v.  Casey , 505 U. S. 833.  The District Court granted summary judg- ment in favor of respondents and permanently enjoined enforcement of the Act, reasoning that Mississippi’s 15-week restriction on abortion violates this Court’s cases forbidding States to ban abortion pre-viabil- ity.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed.  Before this Court, petitioners defend the Act on the grounds that  Roe  and  Casey  were wrongly decided and that the Act is constitutional because it satisfies rational-basis review. Held : The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion;  Roe  and  Casey are overruled; and the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives.  Pp. 8–79. (a) The critical question is whether the Constitution, properly un- derstood, confers a right to obtain an abortion.  Casey ’s controlling opinion skipped over that question and reaffirmed  Roe  solely on the basis of  stare decisis . A proper application of  stare decisis , however, requires an assessment of the strength of the grounds on which  Roe DOBBS  v.  JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION was based. The Court therefore turns to the question that the  Casey plurality did not consider.  Pp. 8–32. \n",
      "\n",
      "234  (1) First, the Court reviews the standard that the Court’s cases have used to determine whether the Fourteenth Amendment’s refer- ence to “liberty” protects a particular right.  The Constitution makes no express reference to a right to obtain an abortion, but several con- stitutional provisions have been offered as potential homes for an im- plicit constitutional right.  Roe  held that the abortion right is part of a right to privacy that springs from the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments.  See 410 U. S., at 152–153.  The  Casey  Court grounded its decision solely on the theory that the right to obtain an abortion is part of the “liberty” protected by the Fourteenth Amend- ment’s Due Process Clause. Others have suggested that support can be found in the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, but that theory is squarely foreclosed by the Court’s precedents, which es- tablish that a State’s regulation of abortion is not a sex-based classifi- cation and is thus not subject to the heightened scrutiny that applies to such classifications.  See  Geduldig  v.  Aiello , 417 U. S. 484, 496, n. 20;  Bray  v.  Alexandria Women’s Health Clinic , 506 U. S. 263, 273– 274. Rather, regulations and prohibitions of abortion are governed by the same standard of review as other health and safety measures. Pp. 9–11. \n",
      "\n",
      "724  (2) Next, the Court examines whether the right to obtain an abor- tion is rooted in the Nation’s history and tradition and whether it is an essential component of “ordered liberty.”  The Court finds that the right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and tradi- tion.  The underlying theory on which  Casey  rested—that the Four- teenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause provides substantive, as well as procedural, protection for “liberty”—has long been controversial. The Court’s decisions have held that the Due Process Clause pro- tects two categories of substantive rights—those rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments to the Constitution and those rights deemed fundamental that are not mentioned anywhere in the Consti- tution. In deciding whether a right falls into either of these categories, the question is whether the right is “deeply rooted in [our] history and tradition” and whether it is essential to this Nation’s “scheme of or- dered liberty.”  Timbs  v.  Indiana , 586 U. S. ___, ___ (internal quotation marks omitted).  The term “liberty” alone provides little guidance. Thus, historical inquiries are essential whenever the Court is asked to recognize a new component of the “liberty” interest protected by the Due Process Clause. In interpreting what is meant by “liberty,” the Court must guard against the natural human tendency to confuse what the Fourteenth Amendment protects with the Court’s own ardent views about the liberty that Americans should enjoy.  For this reason, Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) the Court has been “reluctant” to recognize rights that are not men- tioned in the Constitution.   Collins  v.  Harker Heights , 503 U. S. 115, 125. Guided by the history and tradition that map the essential compo- nents of the Nation’s concept of ordered liberty, the Court finds the Fourteenth Amendment clearly does not protect the right to an abor- tion. Until the latter part of the 20th century, there was no support in American law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion.  No state constitutional provision had recognized such a right.  Until a few years before  Roe , no federal or state court had recognized such a right.  Nor had any scholarly treatise.  Indeed, abortion had long been a  crime  in every single State. At common law, abortion was criminal in at least some stages of pregnancy and was regarded as unlawful and could have very serious consequences at all stages.  American law followed the common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s ex- panded criminal liability for abortions.  By the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, three-quarters of the States had made abor- tion a crime at any stage of pregnancy.  This consensus endured until the day  Roe  was decided.  Roe  either ignored or misstated this history, and  Casey  declined to reconsider  Roe ’s faulty historical analysis. Respondents’ argument that this history does not matter flies in the face of the standard the Court has applied in determining whether an asserted right that is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution is never- theless protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Solicitor Gen- eral repeats  Roe ’s claim that it is “doubtful . . . abortion was ever firmly established as a common-law crime even with respect to the destruc- tion of a quick fetus,” 410 U. S., at 136, but the great common-law au- thorities—Bracton, Coke, Hale, and Blackstone—all wrote that a post- quickening abortion was a crime.  Moreover, many authorities as- serted that even a pre-quickening abortion was “unlawful” and that, as a result, an abortionist was guilty of murder if the woman died from the attempt.  The Solicitor General suggests that history supports an abortion right because of the common law’s failure to criminalize abor- tion before quickening, but the insistence on quickening was not uni- versal, see  Mills  v.  Commonwealth , 13 Pa. 631, 633;  State  v.  Slagle , 83 N. C. 630, 632, and regardless, the fact that many States in the late 18th and early 19th century did not criminalize pre-quickening abor- tions does not mean that anyone thought the States lacked the author- ity to do so. \n",
      "\n",
      "189  Instead of seriously pressing the argument that the abortion right itself has deep roots, supporters of  Roe  and  Casey  contend that the abortion right is an integral part of a broader entrenched right.  Roe termed this a right to privacy, 410 U. S., at 154, and  Casey  described it as the freedom to make “intimate and personal choices” that are “central to personal dignity and autonomy,” 505 U. S., at 851.  Ordered DOBBS  v.  JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION liberty sets limits and defines the boundary between competing inter- ests.  Roe  and  Casey  each struck a particular balance between the in- terests of a woman who wants an abortion and the interests of what they termed “potential life.”   Roe , 410 U. S., at 150;  Casey , 505 U. S., at 852. But the people of the various States may evaluate those inter- ests differently.  The Nation’s historical understanding of ordered lib- erty does not prevent the people’s elected representatives from decid- ing how abortion should be regulated.  Pp. 11–30. \n",
      "\n",
      "431  (3) Finally, the Court considers whether a right to obtain an abor- tion is part of a broader entrenched right that is supported by other precedents. The Court concludes the right to obtain an abortion cannot be justified as a component of such a right.  Attempts to justify abor- tion through appeals to a broader right to autonomy and to define one’s “concept of existence” prove too much.   Casey , 505 U. S., at 851.  Those criteria, at a high level of generality, could license fundamental rights to illicit drug use, prostitution, and the like. What sharply distin- guishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on which  Roe  and  Casey  rely is something that both those decisions acknowledged: Abortion is different because it destroys what  Roe termed “potential life” and what the law challenged in this case calls an “unborn human being.”  None of the other decisions cited by  Roe and  Casey  involved the critical moral question posed by abortion.  Ac- cordingly, those cases do not support the right to obtain an abortion, and the Court’s conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them in any way.  Pp. 30–32. (b) The doctrine of  stare decisis  does not counsel continued ac- ceptance of  Roe  and  Casey .  Stare decisis  plays an important role and protects the interests of those who have taken action in reliance on a past decision.  It “reduces incentives for challenging settled prece- dents, saving parties and courts the expense of endless relitigation.” Kimble  v.  Marvel Entertainment, LLC , 576 U. S. 446, 455.  It “contrib- utes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.” Payne  v.  Tennessee , 501 U. S. 808, 827.  And it restrains judicial hubris by respecting the judgment of those who grappled with important questions in the past.  But  stare decisis  is not an inexorable command, Pearson  v.  Callahan , 555 U. S. 223, 233, and “is at its weakest when [the Court] interpret[s] the Constitution,”  Agostini  v.  Felton , 521 U. S. 203, 235.  Some of the Court’s most important constitutional decisions have overruled prior precedents.  See,  e.g., Brown  v.  Board of Educa- tion , 347 U. S. 483, 491 (overruling the infamous decision in  Plessy  v. Ferguson , 163 U. S. 537, and its progeny). \n",
      "\n",
      "61  The Court’s cases have identified factors that should be considered in deciding when a precedent should be overruled.  Janus  v.  State, County, and Municipal Employees , 585 U. S. ___, ___–___. Five factors Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) discussed below weigh strongly in favor of overruling  Roe  and  Casey . Pp. 39–66. \n",
